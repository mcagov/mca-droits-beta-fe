      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><strong>Usability Restrictions&nbsp;</strong></h2>
      <p  class="govuk-body">The features listed below have restricted usability for the following reasons.</p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>When asked &lsquo;Where was the wreck material located?&rsquo; on the Report Wreck Material service, the &lsquo;Draw on a Map&rsquo; feature is not accessible for navigation by keyboard. In order for this functionality to be available a third-party plugin has been used. Best efforts have been made to provide additional accessible labels to the map, however some elements such as images and icons cannot be altered without changing the fundamental structure of the component. An open text field to provide a detailed location description has been provided as an alternative option.</li>
          <li>The expandable &lsquo;Details&rsquo; component as the &lsquo;known issue&rsquo; is that the command &ldquo;open link&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t always work, users might have to use al alternative &ldquo;open button&rdquo; but it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s unavailable to Assisted Technologies.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we&rsquo;re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
